# **Chapter 10: TBetween Year 11 and Year 12 – When Everything Collided**

This was the year where everything I thought I knew about stability, trust, and family disintegrated into chaos. Between Year 11 and Year 12 wasn’t just another chapter—it was a full-on implosion that forced me into a harsh, unforgiving crash course in survival, betrayal, and the cruelty of those you once called family.

## **🏠 The Fractured Home**

It all started when Mum and Dad finally split. Mum didn’t linger—she moved back to Yeppoon with a speed that left little room for explanation. In the wake of the split, she called me up, her voice dripping with a cocktail of suicidal despair and frantic urgency. Her plan was simple enough: I’d spend Christmas with her for a week. On paper, it sounded fair. Dad wasn’t thrilled about it, but he accepted the arrangement with that resigned heaviness that comes from years of disappointment.

## **🎄 A Christmas Eve of Unseen Blades**

Christmas came, and I flew to Yeppoon expecting some semblance of holiday peace. But peace was a luxury we never truly had. Unbeknownst to me—and not until much later—I learned that on Christmas Eve, around 2 a.m., Mum had taken my phone while I was asleep. In that dark, vulnerable hour, she sent a barrage of abusive text messages to Dad: words like “fucked,” “manipulative,” and other venomous accusations that painted him as the architect of all our misery.

The irony wasn’t lost on me—I adored my Dad. I always believed that his absence was just another twist in the convoluted family drama, not a testament to his inherent cruelty. But when I awoke on Christmas morning to an explosive, rage-filled voice message from him, coupled with a slew of similarly brutal texts, it felt like a knife twisting in my gut. His words—cold, unyielding, and shocking—cut me to the core. Despite my frantic messages trying to reach out, he wouldn’t respond. That day, I was forced to witness the collapse of the one pillar I’d clung to in our fractured family.

Mum’s car “broke down” soon after, and she’d be there, comforting me with a skewed narrative: Dad was the villain, the manipulative monster who’d ruined everything. I wanted to run back to him, to talk and understand what had happened. But it was Christmas—public transport was nonexistent, I couldn’t drive, and I was completely, irretrievably stuck.

## **🚪 The Homeless Christmas**

Three agonizing days later, I finally managed to get to Dad’s place. What I found defied any hope of reconciliation. There, in front of his house, was a litany of signs that our life together was over: a massive skip bin filled with what looked like all my possessions, a jumble of Dad’s stuff, Mum’s remnants—and a house stripped bare of everything that once mattered.

Dad, in his cold, detached manner, told me I was fucked. He wouldn’t let me ask questions; all I got was a curt dismissal as he prepared to return to Newcastle. And just like that, for the next two years, I’d hear from him less than quarterly—a ghost of a man I once knew.

Back at Mum’s, things seemed momentarily more bearable. Her version of events was convincing: she painted Dad as the toxic force, her own instability as a misguided reaction to his abuse. For a fleeting moment, I almost believed her.

Then, about a week after I’d moved into her place, I returned home to a scene straight out of a nightmare. The door was locked; my belongings were strewn on the curb like discarded trash; everything I’d known was gone. My work bag, my clothes—and even my beat-up Daewoo Matiz (which I’d paid a rip-off sum of $3K for from Mum)—had vanished into thin air. She had played me something fierce. In that instant, I was officially homeless, on the brink of starting Year 12, with no rental, no stable family, and no safety net.

## **🤝 A Lifeline in the Darkness**

In my utter isolation, there was one flicker of light: Joey. A friend from my KFC days—someone whose own life had been marred by similar losses—stepped in as a lifeline. For about three months, Joey became my anchor. His own experiences of being out of home since Year 12 made him uniquely capable of understanding my plight. But even his support was temporary; I eventually managed to secure a place on the property of one of the contractors who regularly came to Woolworths. That guy was a legend in his own right, and life there, for a while, felt almost... manageable.

I even had a girlfriend during this period, and for a short time, it felt like things might be turning around. I had a roof over my head, a job, and a sense of autonomy—a taste of the high life for a teenager. Yet, beneath that veneer of success lay the raw, festering pain of being a vulnerable, socially inept teenager forced to fend for himself. It was a recipe for disaster, and disaster wasn’t far behind.

## **🔮 The Unraveling of a Life**

Between Year 11 and Year 12 was the tipping point. Every event—the toxic Christmas, the shock of being abandoned by my own family, the cruelty of losing everything I’d built—piled onto me, creating a pressure that threatened to shatter what little remained of my fragile self. I was forced to confront the brutal reality: trust, family, stability—all were illusions in a world that rewarded survival above all else.

Looking back, that year was a crucible. It broke me in ways that would haunt me for years, but it also forged a determination, a grit that propelled me forward. I learned that even when the ones you love tear you apart, you have to claw your way back. I learned that my resilience was the only true asset I had, and that the world, for all its cruelty, was a place where I could still fight back.

_Next Chapter Tease:_
**Chapter 11: The Family Breakdown & The Game of Isolation**
Up next, we dive deep into the aftermath—a chronicle of how Mum’s fucked-up games to isolate me from my family left me stripped of everything I once held dear. This is the story of betrayal, survival, and the painstaking journey toward reclaiming a life that was stolen piece by piece.

Year 11, and its culmination, wasn’t merely about academic challenges or personal projects—it was about the collapse of a foundation you thought was unshakeable. It was the end of an era, and the painful birth of a man who would never settle for the scraps of broken promises.
