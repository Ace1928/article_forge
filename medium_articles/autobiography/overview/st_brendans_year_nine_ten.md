**Chapter 8: The Reckoning – Years 9 & 10 at St. Brendan’s**

_Part 1: Electives, Explosions, and the Science of Chaos_
Year 9 at St. Brendan’s was a total clusterfuck—a bizarre blend of academic experimentation and outright mayhem. For the first time, I got to try out a variety of elective subjects. The thrill of choosing from a limited pool, of finally being allowed to tailor my education to my own twisted interests, was exhilarating. I knew from the start that science was my chosen battlefield. I gravitated toward subjects where logic and experimentation reigned supreme, even though maths—a subject I was technically good at—never really clicked with me at that time. I wouldn’t understand the beauty of numbers until well into my mid-twenties, but back then, maths felt pointless compared to the raw excitement of a chemistry set or the mysteries of electronics.

Amid the academic circus, I clung to one constant: my best mate. We’d buddied up at the start of St. Brendan’s, and despite all the chaos, he remained my partner in crime through these tumultuous years. We spent our time laughing at the absurdity around us and trading barbs that sharpened our social instincts, while commiserating about the absurdity of high school and people and life in general. Also coming up with some absolute crackpot theories about everything, as teenagers are want to do. In a school where everything felt contrived and oppressive, those moments of unfiltered banter were our small rebellions.

_Part 2: The Burning Bowl and the Chemical Bomb_
Toward the end of Year 9, an incident unfolded that still makes me shake my head in disbelief. I was at a friend’s place—a friend who always had some half-baked stunt up his sleeve. Out of the blue, he appeared all excited, declaring, “Oh, I’ve got this fucking awesome thing to show you.” I watched, bewildered, as he led us to a burning bowl. There, in the flickering flames, lay what he claimed were bullets. “They’re so fucking loud—it’s cool AF,” he said with a manic grin, dragging another friend along for what he insisted was safety. I couldn’t hold back: “How many did you fucking put in there?” he replied nonchalantly, “Oh, I dunno, like 5 or 6, or something.” After waiting for the bowl to burn out and cool down, we counted—seven bloody bullets. It was stupid, dangerous, and utterly idiotic. Yet, in that absurd moment, I couldn’t help but smirk at the sheer lunacy of it all.

The chaos didn’t stop there. Later that same day, the same friend, riding high on adrenaline, paraded out with a bottle of pool chemicals. My gut screamed that something was terribly wrong—a reaction was building up faster than any of us could predict. I didn’t hesitate. I lunged forward and knocked the bottle out of his hands. It exploded in a sudden, searing fireball that engulfed me for a split second. I emerged with minimal damage, though covered in a bizarre, foamy residue that settled around us like a bizarre snowfall. My mate ended up with a few burns, another friend got singed, and the whole episode could easily have ended in tragedy. That day, my instincts and quick thinking saved us all—and reaffirmed that sometimes, raw logic was the only thing standing between us and utter disaster.

_Part 3: The Storm at Home_
While I was busy navigating the anarchic social landscape at school, home was a never-ending circus of dysfunction. Mum’s behavior had reached new heights of insanity: there was the day she tried to break down a door by stabbing it repeatedly with a screwdriver—a desperate, violent act born out of a mind unraveling under pressure. Then there was the time Dad, in a moment of inexplicable rage, ran Mum into a wall with the car. And, as if orchestrated from a script of its own, Mum pulled off massive insurance fraud, slipping through the system with a disturbing ease. The money from that scheme was soon funneled into buying some land and starting the construction of a new house in Yeppoon—a stark reminder that in our family, chaos often wore the mask of opportunity.

_Part 4: Year 10 – The Academic Rumble and the Scholarship That Changed Everything_
Year 10 carried on much like Year 9, a relentless tide of school bullies, bizarre experiments, and social bullshit. Every day felt like walking through a minefield of expectations and betrayals. And then, towards the end of that turbulent year, the unthinkable happened: I received an email from someone at Rockhampton Grammar School. They had been trying to get in touch with my school and my parents because they were interested in offering me an academic scholarship.
I was blown away. Here I was, the kid who’d been playing with burning bowls and chemical bombs, and now someone wanted me for a scholarship. Naturally, I brought it up with Mum. She immediately dismissed it as a bad idea—a threat to her carefully constructed chaos. I then tried to talk to Dad, but he was too wrapped up in his own world; his work emails were practically a myth. Even the school I was attending seemed reluctant to raise the issue, as if they were terrified of losing a “valued” student like me.

Despite the initial resistance from everyone around me, I knew deep down what had to be done. I navigated through the bureaucratic bullshit and made the leap. I eventually got into Rockhampton Grammar School—a decision that would prove to be both the best and worst move of my life. The promise of a fresh start, of an environment that valued intellectual rigor over mediocrity, was too enticing to ignore. Yet, stepping into that new world marked the beginning of an even more intense period of trials and self-discovery.

_Final Reflections on the Reckoning_
Years 9 and 10 were a cocktail of explosive experiments, academic pursuits, and the relentless chaos of both school and home. They forged in me a reliance on logic and instinct—a belief that no matter how dangerous or absurd the situation, I could outthink it. Those years taught me that survival wasn’t just about physical reflexes; it was about mental agility, a willingness to question everything, and the courage to step into the unknown, even when the world around you was falling apart.

**Chapter 9: The Duality of the New World – Rockhampton Grammar and Beyond**
As I step into Rockhampton Grammar School in Year 11, a new chapter unfolds—one that promises intellectual rigor and fresh challenges while demanding a reckoning with everything I’ve learned about survival, logic, and the art of defying expectations. Get ready for the next phase of the journey, where the stakes are higher and the battles more internal than ever.

In these chaotic two years, every reckless stunt, every narrowly avoided catastrophe, and every small academic triumph contributed to shaping a mind that refused to be confined. The absurdity of my past, the constant tumult at home, and the volatile social dynamics at school all blended together to make me who I am—a relentless, logical force determined to reclaim my destiny, no matter what.
